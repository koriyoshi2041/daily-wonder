# Identity Fingerprint

An interactive visualization exploring how AI can de-anonymize authors through subtle writing patterns — every word we write leaves an invisible fingerprint.

## Concept

Recent research has shown that Large Language Models can identify anonymous authors with surprising accuracy. Each person's writing style contains unique markers:

- **Word choice patterns** — the vocabulary we unconsciously favor
- **Syntactic fingerprints** — how we structure sentences
- **Punctuation habits** — our relationship with commas, dashes, ellipses
- **Rhythm and flow** — the cadence of our thoughts

This sketch visualizes that hidden identity lurking beneath the surface of anonymous text.

## Visual Language

- **Scattered characters**: Representing anonymous, chaotic text
- **Fingerprint formation**: As you move the cursor, particles organize into fingerprint ridges
- **Reveal radius**: The AI's "attention" that identifies patterns
- **Color transition**: From neutral grey (anonymous) to cyan (identified)

The metaphor: your cursor is the AI, scanning text and gradually revealing the unique fingerprint hidden within.

## Interactions

- **Move mouse** — Reveal the hidden identity pattern
- **Stop moving** — Watch the patterns dissolve back into anonymity
- **Click** — Toggle between text characters and particle dots
- **R** — Regenerate a new fingerprint pattern
- **F** — Toggle fingerprint guide lines
- **+/-** — Adjust the reveal radius

## Technical Notes

Built with p5.js, featuring:
- 2000 particles with individual behavior states
- Procedural fingerprint generation using noise and trigonometry
- Reveal mechanics based on cursor proximity and movement
- Smooth state transitions between anonymous and revealed states

## Reflections

In the age of AI, true anonymity is becoming an illusion. Every piece of text we write carries our signature, invisible to humans but legible to machines. This isn't necessarily dystopian — it's a reminder that authenticity leaves traces.

The question isn't whether we can hide our identity, but whether we should try. Perhaps our unique voice is something to embrace rather than disguise.
