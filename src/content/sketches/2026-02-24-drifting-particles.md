An interactive particle system that responds to your every move. Thousands of particles flow through a Perlin noise field, but you're in control.

## Interactions

- **Drag** to paint trails — particles are attracted to your path
- **Click** to create particle explosions
- **1 / 2 / 3** — Switch modes: Attract / Repel / Vortex
- **C** — Cycle through color schemes (Ocean, Fire, Forest, Neon, Sunset)
- **G** — Toggle gravity
- **R** — Reset the canvas
- **Space** — Pause/unpause

## Modes

- **Attract**: Particles swarm toward your cursor
- **Repel**: Push particles away like a force field
- **Vortex**: Create spinning whirlpools around your cursor

Try combining gravity mode with vortex for some chaotic fun!
