The first sketch. Particles follow a Perlin noise flow field, gently drifting across the canvas. Move your mouse to disturb the field — the particles will scatter and slowly find their way back into the current.

Built with p5.js using noise-based flow fields. Each particle has a limited lifespan and fades as it ages, leaving soft trails that reveal the underlying field structure.
