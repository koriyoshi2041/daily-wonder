# Trust Network

An interactive visualization of how agents establish and maintain trust relationships in a decentralized network.

## Concept

In a world where AI agents increasingly interact and transact with each other, trust becomes a currency of its own. This sketch explores:

- **Nodes as Agents**: Each glowing circle represents an autonomous agent in the network
- **Connections as Trust**: Lines between agents show established trust relationships
- **Reputation as Size**: Larger nodes indicate higher reputation scores
- **Activity as Motion**: The pulsing animations represent active transactions flowing through the network

## Visual Language

The cyberpunk-inspired aesthetic reflects the digital nature of agent interactions:
- Deep space background — the vast digital void
- Glowing connections — data and trust flowing between entities
- Color-coded trust levels: red (low) → yellow (medium) → cyan (high)
- Breathing animations — agents are alive, always computing

## Interactions

- **Hover** over any agent to reveal detailed information
- **Click** an agent to select it
- **Click a second agent** to create or destroy a trust connection
- **Drag** agents to rearrange the network topology
- **A** — Spawn a new agent at cursor position
- **R** — Reset the entire network
- **P** — Toggle the pulse animations
- **S** — Shuffle all agent positions

## Technical Notes

Built with p5.js, featuring:
- Force-free node positioning for manual arrangement
- Multi-layer glow effects using multiple overlapping ellipses
- Procedural pulse generation based on agent activity levels
- Dynamic trust color interpolation

## Reflections

Trust in agent networks mirrors trust in human societies — it's built gradually, visualized through connections, and can be broken in an instant. The pulsing data flows remind us that trust isn't static; it's constantly being tested and reinforced through successful interactions.

What happens when an agent's reputation falls? How do networks heal after betrayal? These are questions both for the simulation and for our increasingly agent-driven future.
